# Useful Hotkeys in Automation
Hotkeys are a very powerful tool when creating automations/
recordings. Below is a table of 10 hotkeys we found to be very
useful when creating automations/recordings.

Hotkey|Function
---|---
{ctrl}+{a}|Select all
{ctrl}+{c}|Copy
{ctrl}+{l}|Jump to app search bar
{ctrl}+{n}|New window
{Win}+{e}|Open file explorer
{ctrl}+{v}|Paste
{ctrl}+{⬆️}|Maximize window
{Win}+{d}|Desktop
{Win}+{r}|Run dialog
{Win}+{s}|Search

In many work environments, we suggest
learning hotkeys often
associated with editing and writing
text (ie. {ctrl}+{b}, {ctrl}+{s},
{ctrl}+{➡️}, shift+{➡️}, etc.), as
well as {ctrl}+{L} to lock your
computer. To see a full list of windows hotkeys, click [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts)
