# AssistMe ReadME
AssistMe is a AutoHotkey and Python program for windows. The
purpose of AssistMe is to aid with writing automations, and
to determine the utility of macro-software (short programs)
to be used to complete some of the repetitive micro-tasks
that reduce productively on computers.

## Future Work
Currently, the "Smart Macros" feature in our program does
nothing. In the future, we will implement this feature which
suggests automating processes at specific times. Further,
we would like to find AutoHotkey alternatives for Mac and
Ubuntu and add support for our program on these OS's.
Lastly, code maintenance and additional test cases should be
added to ensure reliability.
